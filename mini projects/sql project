Today I started working on a guided sql project on Dataquest. 

Issue: I'm having trouble accessing the database locally. It looks like other people have had a similar issue. 
So far, I haven't been able to resolve this but I will try again tomorrow and if that doesn't work, I'll work on the project from the dataquest interface.
