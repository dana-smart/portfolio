# Ready for your Sandra Bullock Movie Marathon?

## 🧐 What is the problem statement?
"Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress (for real my friend's favorite actress!) but I'm pretty sure I haven't seen all her movies. I want a table that contains a list of all her movies that I can cross reference when I start binging her movies next week. When you get a chance, I'd love to know more about the box office sales too."

## 🛠️ What tools did you use? 
I used two Python libraries:
- Requests 
- Beautiful Soup

## 😏 What's the result?
A csv file with the list of movies and their release year

## 🤓 What resources did you reference?
  - Bootcamp lecture notes
  - Beautiful Soup documentation

## 😤 What challenges did you come across?
Low key embarassed to say that it took me a looooooong minute to realize that I wasn't entering the correct class name (check my notes in the notebook for deets). 

## 🔜 What are your next steps?
  ☐ Start the printed row index at 1\
  ☐ Find and scrape box office sales\
  ☐ Add box office sale totals to corresponding movie\
  ☐ Make sure cells in csv file aligned properly\
  ☐ Add column with checkbox so that client can check it off after watching the movie\
  ☐ Use tableau to create graphs using the release year and box office sales\
  ☐ Create a little story with these findings and put into a report
